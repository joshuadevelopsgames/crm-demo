# Unique Characteristics of Excluded Data

## Summary

The estimates that LMN excludes from dollar calculations have **distinct patterns** that differentiate them from included estimates.

---

## Key Differences: Included vs Excluded

### Included Estimates (676 estimates, $11.15M)
- **Average price:** $16K
- **Average hours:** 30.7 hours
- **Status:** Contract Signed (300), Work Complete (248), Billing Complete (128)
- **Pattern:** Normal production work with reasonable hours-to-price ratio

### Excluded Estimates - Three Distinct Groups

---

## Group 1: Zero/Missing Labor Hours (242 estimates, $1.44M)

### Unique Characteristics:
- **Average price:** $6K (lower than included)
- **Labor hours:** 0 or missing (KEY DIFFERENCE)
- **Status breakdown:**
  - Contract Signed: 99
  - Billing Complete: 89
  - Work Complete: 35
  - Email Contract Award: 18
  - Verbal Contract Award: 1
- **Division breakdown:**
  - LE Maintenance (Summer/Winter): 101
  - LE Irrigation: 98
  - LE Paving: 35
  - Line Painting: 4
  - Parking Lot Sweeping: 3
- **Pipeline Status:** All "Sold" (100%)
- **Average price:** $6K (lower than included $16K)

### Why They're Excluded:
- **No production work** - These are likely:
  - Design-only jobs
  - Consulting services
  - Permits/licenses
  - Flat-fee services
  - Material-only purchases
- LMN excludes them because they don't represent "production" work that generates labor hours

### Unique Pattern:
- **Lower average price** ($6K vs $16K for included)
- **All have Pipeline="Sold"** but no labor hours
- **Heavy concentration in Maintenance and Irrigation** divisions

---

## Group 2: Email/Verbal Contract Award (114 estimates, $2.64M)

### Unique Characteristics:
- **Average price:** $23K (higher than included $16K)
- **Status:** Email Contract Award (106) or Verbal Contract Award (8)
- **Labor hours:** 95 out of 114 have hours (83% have hours)
- **Division breakdown:**
  - LE Maintenance (Summer/Winter): 96 (84%)
  - LE Landscapes: 11
  - LE Maintenance Enhancements: 3
  - Parking Lot Sweeping: 3
- **Pipeline Status:** All "Sold" (100%)
- **Average price:** $23K (higher than included $16K)

### Why They're Excluded:
- **Status distinction:** LMN distinguishes between:
  - **"Won"** (CRM state) - Email/Verbal Contract Award
  - **"Contract Awarded"** (operational state) - Contract Signed, Work Complete, Billing Complete
- Estimates that are "won" but never reach "contract awarded" status are excluded from dollar calculations
- These may be:
  - Estimates that were awarded but contracts were never finalized
  - Estimates that stalled before production
  - Estimates that were cancelled after award

### Unique Pattern:
- **Higher average price** ($23K vs $16K for included)
- **Status is the key differentiator** - Email/Verbal vs Contract Signed
- **Mostly Maintenance division** (84% in LE Maintenance)

---

## Group 3: Suspicious Estimates (> $100K, < 10 hours) (14 estimates, $2.35M)

### Unique Characteristics:
- **Average price:** $168K (10x higher than included $16K!)
- **Average hours:** 2.0 hours (extremely low)
- **Price-to-hours ratio:** ~$84,000/hour (vs ~$520/hour for included)
- **Division:** All 14 are in "LE Maintenance (Summer/Winter)"
- **Status:** All "Contract Signed"
- **Pipeline Status:** All "Sold" (100%)

### Why They're Excluded:
- **Design/consulting pattern:** Extremely high price with minimal hours suggests:
  - Design-only work
  - Consulting services
  - Estimates signed but never actually produced
  - System-generated or test estimates
- The price-to-hours ratio is **160x higher** than normal production work

### Unique Pattern:
- **Extremely high price** ($168K average vs $16K for included)
- **Extremely low hours** (2.0 average vs 30.7 for included)
- **All in Maintenance division**
- **All Contract Signed** (not Email/Verbal awards)

| Characteristic | Included | Zero Hours | Email/Verbal | Suspicious |
|---------------|----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Count** | 676 | 242 | 114 | 14 |
| **Avg Price** | $16K | $6K | $23K | $168K |
| **Avg Hours** | 30.7 | 0 | ~25* | 2.0 |
| **Price/Hour** | ~$520 | N/A | ~$920* | ~$84,000 |
| **Status** | Contract Signed, Work Complete, Billing Complete | Mixed | Email/Verbal Award | Contract Signed |
| **Pipeline** | Sold (100%) | Sold (100%) | Sold (100%) | Sold (100%) |
| **Top Division** | Maintenance (160) | Maintenance (101) | Maintenance (96) | Maintenance (14) |

*Estimated based on 95/114 having hours

## Key Insights

### 1. **Zero Hours = No Production Work**
- Lower average price ($6K)
- Represents non-production services
- LMN excludes because they don't generate labor hours

### 2. **Email/Verbal Award = Not Contract Awarded**
- Higher average price ($23K)
- Status is the key - "awarded" but not "contract awarded"
- LMN excludes because they never reached operational state

### 3. **High Price + Low Hours = Design/Consulting**
- Extremely high price ($168K)
- Extremely low hours (2.0)
- Price-to-hours ratio is 160x normal
- LMN excludes because they're not production work

---

## The Pattern

**LMN's logic:** Exclude estimates that don't represent **actual production work** from dollar calculations:
- No labor hours = no production
- Email/Verbal award = not contract awarded = no production
- High price + low hours = design/consulting = no production

**Included estimates:** All have reasonable hours-to-price ratios and represent actual production work.

---

## Why This Matters

These exclusions make business sense:
- **Sales performance** should measure **production work**, not design/consulting
- **Contract awarded** is different from **won** - only awarded contracts produce work
- **Zero hours** means no production happened, even if money changed hands

This explains why LMN excludes them from dollar calculations while still counting them in the estimate count (they were "sold" but don't represent production work).
